## Getting Started

To get started with YumRev, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/CS222-UIUC/course-project-team46.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd course-project-team46
cd client
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Now the application should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You can add a section in your README file to let users know that they can use the `test_backend` folder for testing purposes without a database. Here's an example of how you can include this information:

## Testing without a Database

If you don't have a database set up but still want to test the application, you can use the `test_backend` folder inside the `client` folder. The `test_backend` contains a simplified version of the back-end that uses Express and does not require a database.

To use the `test_backend`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `test_backend` folder:

```bash
cd course-project-team46
cd client/test_backend
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the Express server:

```bash
npm start
```

Now the test back-end server should be running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Please note that this test back-end has limited functionality compared to the full back-end with a database. It is meant for testing purposes only.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Structure

Below is an overview of the main folders and files in the YumRev project:

- **build**: Contains the production build files generated by `npm run build`.
- **public**: Contains the public assets like favicon, logos, and static images.
- **src**: Contains the main source code of the application, including components, pages, and styles.
    - **components**: Contains all the reusable UI components used throughout the application, such as AppBar, Comments, Filter, Footer, and more.
    - **data**: Contains the data files for the application, including restaurant data in JSON format. (used for testing)
    - **pages**: Contains the individual pages of the application, such as AboutUsPage, HomePage, LoginPage, and others.
    - **style**: Contains the global style configurations for the application.
    - **utils**: Contains utility functions and reusable code snippets, such as form validation.
- **.env**: Contains environment variables and configurations.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git.
- **package.json**: Contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the project.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.

The entry point of the application is the `src/index.js` file, which imports and renders the main `App` component from `src/App.js`. The `App` component is responsible for managing the overall structure and layout of the application, as well as rendering the different pages based on the current route.

## Components

Below is a list and brief description of the main components used in the YumRev application:

- **AppBar**: Represents the application's top navigation bar, which contains menu items and user-related actions.
- **Comments**: Manages the display and submission of comments for a restaurant, including the CommentForm, CommentList, and SingleComment components.
- **Filter**: Provides a filtering interface to help users refine the displayed list of restaurants based on restaurant type.
- **Footer**: Represents the application's footer, which contains copyright information and links to relevant pages.
- **LikeDislikeActions**: Manages the like and dislike functionality for a single comment, allowing users to express their preferences.
- **Logo**: Displays the YumRev logo and provides a link to the homepage.
- **MenuTable**: Displays a restaurant's menu items in a tabular format.
- **NavMenu**: Represents menu on `AppBar`, which contains links to different sections of the application.
- **RestaurantDetails**: Provides an overview of a restaurant's details, such as name, location, and rating.
- **RestaurantList**: Displays a list of restaurants, including the ability to sort and paginate the list. The list includes the RenderRow and RestaurantListHeader components.
- **RestaurantListWithFilter**: Combines the RestaurantList and Filter components, allowing users to search for restaurants based on their preferences.
- **RestaurantReferral**: Displays a carousel of recommended restaurants, allowing users to navigate through the list using arrows. Each visible card in the carousel is an instance of the RestaurantReferralCard component, which shows the details of a referred restaurant. The component accepts an array of restaurant details as a prop and manages the carousel's state using the useState React Hook.
- **RestaurantReferralCard**: Represents the visual card displaying the details of a referred restaurant.
- **SearchBar**: Provides a search interface to help users find specific restaurants by name, address or other.
- **StarRating**: Displays a star rating system for users to rate a restaurant.
- **UserMenu**: Provides a menu with user-related actions, such as login, register, and logout.

These components can be found in the `src/components` folder, and they are organized based on their functionality and purpose within the application.
